Computer Networks Lab Program list


1. Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client-server program to make client send the file name
and the server to send back the contents of the requested file name “sample.txt”
with the following contents: “Hello we are at Computer Networks Lab” Display
suitable error message in case the file is not present in the server.


2. Write a program to find shortest paths from source to all nodes in the network graph
using Bellman Ford Algorithm.


3. Write a program to find shortest paths from source to all nodes in the network graph
using Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm.


4. Write a program for implementing the error detection technique for data transfer in
unreliable network code using CRC (16-bits) Technique.


5. Write a program to implement internet checksum for error correction and detection.


6. Write a program to achieve Traffic management at Flow level by implementing Leaky
Bucket Algorithm.


7. Packets from different flows arrive at a switch or router for processing. A good
scheduling technique treats the different flows in a fair and appropriate manner.
Implement priority queuing as a technique to improve Quality of Service.


8. Write a program to implement Go Back N sliding window protocol


9. Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.
